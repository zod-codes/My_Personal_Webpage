    <h3>Lady changes her mind about marrying Nigerian lover, walks away from wedding venue as they exchanged vows
        (video)</h3>
    <p>A Nigerian man was left in distress after being abandoned by his fiancee during their wedding.



        The incident happened in Bangladesh and it was learnt that the couple met on Facebook, before the lady invited
        the Nigerian man to her country for their wedding.


        The lady who changed her mind on marrying the Nigerian man, was heard saying “you are a very good man and you
        have your life together” before walking away while crying.


        A lady was also heard saying in the background “church agbasala” (everything has crashed) as the lady walked
        out.
